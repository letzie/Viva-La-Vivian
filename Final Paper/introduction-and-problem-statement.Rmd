## Introduction and Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to find out what factors are significant in determining the education requirements for a job posting, and for us to be able to use these significant factors to predict the education requirements for job postings. Our goal is to inform individuals in the job market of what kind of jobs can be attained with different levels of education requirements. To help us achieve our objective, we looked at multiple distributions of job education requirements against our other variables in order to visualize the relationships. For prediction modeling, we ran a logistic regression model to predict the level of education requirement for a given job. The main research question that we are trying to answer is: What factors play a significant role in determining the education requirements for a job posting? Can we use our model to predict the education requirements for jobs that lacked education information in their posting?
