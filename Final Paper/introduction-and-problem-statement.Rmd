## Introduction and Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to find out what factors are significant in determining the estimated salary of a job posting, and for us to be able to use these significant factors to predict estimated salary. Our goal is to provide individuals in the job market with a sense of what is important when determining the estimated salary of a position that they covet. To help us achieve our objective, we looked at multiple distributions of estimated salary against our other variables in order to visualize the relationships. For prediction modeling, we ran a linear regression model to predict estimated salaries.
