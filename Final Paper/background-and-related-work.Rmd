## Background and Related Work

\quad The data that we are performing our analysis on comes from the 2018 DataFest dataset that contains information about job postings on the job hunting site Indeed. Our data contains variables detailing the specifics of each job posting such as: City Location, Education Requirement, Average Company Rating (1-5). In order to narrow our focus onto a particular city and state, we decided to subset our data such that only job postings in Los Angeles, CA are included in our scope of analysis, bringing down the total number of observations from over 14 million to approximately 93,000.
